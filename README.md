# Automation-Selenium
A repository showcasing my work on selenium

1. SeleniumDemo: This is a java project where I worked on handling basic web elements using seleinum.

   Handled different web elements such as text box, radio button, check box, dropdown, date picker, uploading a file by filling up a form in 'Form.java'. Automated a 2 factor login form created through 'login.html' in 'Login.java' where the second authentication(OTP) is present beore hand and successfully verified it by extracting the OTP from the webpage and Handled different alerts using different alert actions in 'Alerts.java'.

2. TestNGDemo: A java project where I worked upon testng framework

   Worked on testng framework and used different annotations to test the methods. In 'com.testng' package I worked on the functionality of testng without any selenium. Created a student class and a method to calculate the grade based on the marks given at the input and finally created a test method where I used assert method to compare the actual ouput and expected output.
In 'com.testng.demo' worked on the testng framework along with selenium where I automated a flow where I login into a dummy shopping website add a product into cart and logout. Used different 'Before' and 'After' annotations.  

3. MavenDemo: A Maven project where I worked on the maven proejct workflow and how to use selenium in it

   I Performed a simple login testing initially without selenium through 'App.java' and 'AppTest.java' where I tested a positive and negative scenario by giving different credentials. Then I performed a test on a method in 'TS_Login.java' which contains selenium where I logged into a test website and compare the title to the expected title.\
Used Maven Surefire plugin in order to test all the test methods present in the project.
